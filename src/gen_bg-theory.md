```

> Statistics, Machine Learning and Data Science can sometimes seem like very scary topics, but since each technique is really just a combination of small and simple steps, they are actually quite simple. My goal with StatQuest is to break down the major methodologies into easy to understand pieces. That said, I don't dumb down the material. Instead, I build up your understanding so that you are smarter.

> This guide is intended for anyone having zero or a small background in programming, maths, and machine learning. There is no specific order to follow, but a classic path would be from top to bottom. If you don't like reading books, skip it, if you don't want to follow an online course, you can skip it as well. There is not a single way to become a machine learning expert and with motivation, you can absolutely achieve it.
>
> All resources listed here are free, except some online courses and books, which are certainly recommended for a better understanding, but it is definitely possible to become an expert without them, with a little more time spent on online readings, videos and practice. When it comes to paying courses, the links in this guide are affiliated links. Please, use them if you feel like following a course as it will support me. Thank you, and have fun learning! Remember, this is completely up to you and not necessary. I felt like it was useful to me and maybe useful to others as well.

#### *Designing ML Systems* summary

```info
:: Tagline: Web platform for the design and execution of deep learning models for learning and initiation in the study of deep learning models.
:: Repository: <https://github.com/SIMIDAT/nets4learning>
```

>The tool proposes different classical machine learning problems with known data sets to study and model different neural network architectures and training parameters. The tool addresses different examples of deep learning models such as tabular classification, image classifier or object identification.
> 
> There are some classical problems prepared and reviewed to make predictions, the tool has the feature to preprocess data sets that the user uploads, train models and predict in which class it would be classified.

#### Flux Model Zoo

```info
:: Tagline: Please do not feed the models
:: Repository: <https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo>
```

> This repository contains various demonstrations of the Flux machine learning library. Any of these may freely be used as a starting point for your own models.
> 
> The models are broadly categorised into the folders vision (e.g. large convolutional neural networks (CNNs)), text (e.g. various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and natural language processing (NLP) models), games (Reinforcement Learning / RL). See the READMEs of respective models for more information.

```admonition warning
Note that Flux is a library written for the Julia programming langauge (i.e. not Python).
