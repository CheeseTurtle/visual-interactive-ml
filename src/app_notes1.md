# Appendix A: Annotation and Notekeeping {.pagetoc-exclude}

## Collaborative web annotation

There are probably others, but here is what I have found so far.

####  hypothes.is {.pagetoc-exclude}

```info
:::: ![](assets/2023-12-15-17-34-36.png)
:: Tagline: Collaborate with anyone, anywhere. Use Hypothesis to annotate anything online with classmates, colleagues, or friends.
:: Website: <https://web.hypothes.is/>
:: Repository: <https://github.com/hypothesis>
:: Roadmap: <https://web.hypothes.is/product-update/>
```

Many notekeeping options (see below) have plugins for integration with Hypothesis.

## Hierarchical note-taking with backlinks and cross-references

### Primarily Offline Interface

These offer limited real-time collaboration but don't have the same lock-in effect (so you aren't constrained to stay with any particular system, service, or app). Furthermore, unlike the systems that are primarily online services, users can create plugins for them.

#### Obsidian {.pagetoc-exclude}

```info
:: Tagline: Obsidian is the private and flexible note‑taking app that adapts to the way you think.
:: Price: Free; pay for sync hosting <a href="https://obsidian.md/pricing">(pricing here)</a>
:: File format: Markdown (.md)
:: Plugins: <https://obsidian.md/plugins>
:: Website: <https://obsidian.md/>
:: Roadmap: <https://obsidian.md/roadmap/>
```

Supposedly more well-polished and full-featured than Logseq.

Has plugins (2000+) for Hypothesis integration, time-synced notes on audio files, automatic captioning, PDF annotation, [embedded drawings](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/excalidraw-full-featured-sketching-plugin-in-obsidian/17367), chemistry diagrams, integrated terminals, graphical chart editing, flashcards and spaced repetition, and more.

Anyone can develop their own plugins with the plugin API.

Has apps for every major platform.

Has plugins (150+) for Hypothesis integration, time-synced notes on audio files, automatic captioning, PDF annotation, embedded drawings, chemistry diagrams, integrated terminals, graphical chart editing, flashcards and spaced repetition, and more.

Anyone can develop their own plugins with the plugin API.

Has apps for every major platform.

#### OneNote {.pagetoc-exclude}

```info
:: Tagline: One cross-functional notebook for all your notetaking needs.
:: Price: included with Office365
:: File format: Proprietary
:: Website: <https://www.onenote.com/>
:: Product Overview: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app>
```

Perhaps more intuitive to use than Obsidian, and is part of the Microsoft ecosystem. However, there are fewer plugins (for integration with other services) and the notes cannot be edited with other programs.

Offers better real-time collaboration features than the other offline-oriented options.

Has apps for every major platform and a web interface.

### Primarily/Exclusively Online

These offer effortless real-time collaboration (whereas collaboration with the above \[except OneNote] would be more like pushing to a Git repository) but are generally pricier, lack robust offline access to notes, and have much higher lock-in (meaning it's difficult, if not nearly impossible, to migrate to other note systems). Editing using other editors is generally not possible, although usually there are export options. (However, lots of exporting and importing is not convenient and also does not make use of the collaborative features.)

#### Notion {.pagetoc-exclude}

```info
:: Tagline: Notion is the connected workspace where better, faster work happens.
:: Price: Free with limitations; [pricing here](https://www.notion.so/pricing)
:: File format: N/A (no offline interface; some export options)
:: Website: <https://www.notion.so/product>

## Markdown editors geared towards research/academia

These are compatible with systems that are based on Markdown (.md) files, such as [Obsidian](#obsidian) and [Logseq](#logseq). (Note that while the online-oriented systems typically also make use of Markdown *syntax*, transparent access to Markdown files is not available.)

#### Zettlr {.pagetoc-exclude}

## Academic literature and citation management

### Reference Managers

#### Zotero {.pagetoc-exclude}

```info
:: Tagline: Your personal research assistant: Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research.
:: Price: Free, with the option to buy additional cloud storage
:: Website: <https://zotero.org>
:: Repository: <https://github.com/zotero/zotero>
```

I've noticed that more note-keeping, citation management, and bibliography tools have integration options for Zotero than do for Mendeley. This leads me to believe that Zotero is more popular / widely used. This could also be due to observation bias since I am personally only familiar with Zotero.

Has apps for all major platforms. Not the prettiest per se, but has plenty of useful features.

![](assets/2023-12-15-20-57-53.png)

Note also [zoterobib](https://zbib.org/), an officially-endorsed bibliography tool. (Not the same as Zotero, but made by the same development team.)

![](assets/2023-12-15-20-56-37.png)

#### Mendeley {.pagetoc-exclude}

```info
:: Price: Probably not free, because Elsevier.
:: Website: <https://wwww.mendeley.com/guides/mendeley-reference-manager/>
```

Appears to be a subset of Elsevier, as its homepage (<www.mendeley.com>) redirected me to the Elsevier website after a short delay.

### Article Managers 
#### ReadCube {.pagetoc-exclude}

```info
:::: ![](assets/2023-12-15-20-19-52.png)
:: Tagline: Transform how your team works with scholarly literature
:: Price: Pricing not listed, but definitely not free

The ReadCube website has [a page](https://www.readcube.com/en/comparison/) where it provides comparisons of its services with those of Rightfind, Article Galaxy, Endnote, and Mendeley. I find it a bit suspicious that it doesn't compare itself with Paperpile or any of the other popular similar services.

#### PaperPile {.pagetoc-exclude}

```info
:::: ![](assets/2023-12-15-20-28-12.png)
:: Tagline: The no-fuss reference manager for the web;<br/>Manage your research library right in your browser.
:: Price: $2.99/mo ([pricing](https://paperpile.com/pricing/))
:: Website: <https://paperpile.com/>
```

See its [Features](https://paperpile.com/features/) page for an overview. (Categories: Manage References, Find and Collect, Organize PDFs, Highlight and annotate, Share and Collaborate, Cite in Google Docs).

Its [Feature Roadmap](https://paperpile.com/roadmap/) is also available for viewing.

Advertises that it has a plugin for Microsoft Word and Google Docs. It also has mobile apps for Android/iOS.
