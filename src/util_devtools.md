> Graphbook is a new visual IDE for AI and deep learning model development that lets you build and run directly on a visualization. For example, you can customize transformers directly in the platform, train, and serve them to a URL. Graphbook is still in beta mode and we are developing more models and product features over time.

The Github repository contains a number of [NLP models](https://github.com/cerbrec/graphbook/tree/master/nlp_models), grouped into the following categories:
+ Classifiers
+ Generators
+ Next Token
+ Tokenizers
+ Transformers

There is also a small [Community Gallery](https://github.com/cerbrec/graphbook/tree/master/community_gallery).

A Python scripting interface ("PyGraphbook") is [in progress](https://github.com/cerbrec/graphbook/tree/master/PyGraphbook).
